``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

### Problem 1

``` r
nyc <- read_csv("./nyc_transit.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name,station_latitude,station_longitude, route1:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada) 
```

### Problem 2

Load the datasets

``` r
mr_df <- read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx","Mr. Trash Wheel","A2:N534")%>%
 janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(year) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls=as.integer(sports_balls)) %>% 
   mutate(trash_wheel = "mr")
```

``` r
prof_df <- read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx","Professor Trash Wheel","A2:N116")%>%
 janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls=as.integer(sports_balls))%>% 
   mutate(trash_wheel = "prof")
```

Combining the data

``` r
trash_df <- bind_rows(mr_df,prof_df)
```

In the Mr. Trash Wheel data set there are 453 observations and 15
variables. Some of the key variables in this dataset are Weight of trash
in tons and the volume of trash in cubic yards. The total number of
sports balls collected in 2020 by Mr. Trash Wheel is 856.

In the Professor Trash Wheel data set there are 71 observations and 15
variables. Some of the key variables in this dataset are Weight of trash
in tons and the volume of trash in cubic yards. The total weight of
trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 135.5 tons.

### Problem 3

Load the datasets and clean them

``` r
pols_df <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
  president = recode(prez_dem, `1` = "dem", `0` = "gop")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day)) 
```

``` r
snp_df <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") 
dates <- snp_df$date %>% 
  as.Date(., "%m/%d/%y") %>%  
  as.Date(ifelse(dates > Sys.Date(), format(dates, "19%y-%m-%d"), format(dates)))
snp_df$date = dates

snp_df <- snp_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

``` r
unemp_df<- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
   pivot_longer(
    jan:dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  ) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Putting the datasets together

``` r
final_df <- 
  pols_df %>% 
  left_join(snp_df, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemp_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The `pols-month.csv` dataset contains information about politicians and
the number of which are democratic or republican govenors or senators.
After cleaning it has 822 observations and 9 variables. The `snp.csv`
dataset contains information about the stock S&P’s closing value for
each day of observation. After cleaning, this data set has 787
observations and 4 variables. The `unemployment.csv` dataset contains
information about the unemployment rate for each month throughout the
years in the dataset. After cleaning, this dataset has 816 observations
and 3 variables.

After combining the datasets, the resulting data set contains 822
observations and 12 variables. The years included in the combined
dataset range from 1947 to 2015. Some of the key variables are
`president`, `close`, and `unemp_rate`.
