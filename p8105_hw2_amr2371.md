library(readxl)
```

### Problem 1

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The process begins with
data import, updates variable names, and selects the columns that will
be used in later parts fo this problem. We update `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that
`Route` columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7.

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "./nyc_transit.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance
as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of
rows is the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow
vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable – this logical, so
taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will
coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first
step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert
`route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from
previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and
on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes
with the required stations in rows).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    station_name                  line           
    ##    <chr>                         <chr>          
    ##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue       
    ##  3 145th St                      8 Avenue       
    ##  4 14th St                       8 Avenue       
    ##  5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue       
    ##  6 175th St                      8 Avenue       
    ##  7 181st St                      8 Avenue       
    ##  8 190th St                      8 Avenue       
    ##  9 34th St                       8 Avenue       
    ## 10 42nd St                       8 Avenue       
    ## # … with 50 more rows

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>%

### Problem 2

Load the datasets

``` r
mr_df <- read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx","Mr. Trash Wheel","A2:N534")%>%
 janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(year) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls=as.integer(sports_balls)) %>% 
   mutate(trash_wheel = "mr")
```

``` r
prof_df <- read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx","Professor Trash Wheel","A2:N116")%>%
 janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls=as.integer(sports_balls))%>% 
   mutate(trash_wheel = "prof")
```

Combining the data

``` r
trash_df <- bind_rows(mr_df,prof_df)
```

In the Mr. Trash Wheel data set there are 453 observations and 15
variables. Some of the key variables in this dataset are Weight of trash
in tons and the volume of trash in cubic yards. The total number of
sports balls collected in 2020 by Mr. Trash Wheel is 856.

In the Professor Trash Wheel data set there are 71 observations and 15
variables. Some of the key variables in this dataset are Weight of trash
in tons and the volume of trash in cubic yards. The total weight of
trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 135.5 tons.

### Problem 3

Load the datasets and clean them

``` r
pols_df <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
  president = recode(prez_dem, `1` = "dem", `0` = "gop")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day)) 
```

``` r
snp_df <- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") 
dates <- snp_df$date %>% 
  as.Date(., "%m/%d/%y") %>%  
  as.Date(ifelse(dates > Sys.Date(), format(dates, "19%y-%m-%d"), format(dates)))
snp_df$date = dates

snp_df <- snp_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

``` r
unemp_df<- read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
   pivot_longer(
    jan:dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  ) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Putting the datasets together

``` r
final_df <- 
  pols_df %>% 
  left_join(snp_df, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemp_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The `pols-month.csv` dataset contains information about politicians and
the number of which are democratic or republican govenors or senators.
After cleaning it has 822 observations and 9 variables. The `snp.csv`
dataset contains information about the stock S&P’s closing value for
each day of observation. After cleaning, this data set has 787
observations and 4 variables. The `unemployment.csv` dataset contains
information about the unemployment rate for each month throughout the
years in the dataset. After cleaning, this dataset has 816 observations
and 3 variables.

After combining the datasets, the resulting data set contains 822
observations and 12 variables. The years included in the combined
dataset range from 1947 to 2015. Some of the key variables are
`president`, `close`, and `unemp_rate`.
